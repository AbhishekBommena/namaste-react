# Assignment - 3
1. What is JSX?

âž¡ JSX is not HTML in Javascript.

âž¡ JSX is a syntax. It is HTML-like syntax OR XML-like syntax.

âž¡ JSX is different, and React is different.

âž¡ For ex: "const heading = React.createElement("h1",{}, "Core React")" => 
    Basically, this is the core react way of creating react elements whereas, *const heading = p-tag JSX way p-tag* => This is JSX's way of creating react elements.

âž¡ JS engine doesn't understand JSX.

âž¡ JSX is transpiled before it reaches the JS Engine by parcel(Not itself but Babel will do that).

âž¡ So what happens is, JSX => React.createElement() => React element which is JS Object => Html element.

âž¡ Babel does all this conversion.

2. Super Power of JSX

âž¡ Inside JSX Javascript can also be used with curly braces.

âž¡ JSX prevents cross-site scripting attacks(when data comes from an API and it is malicious then JSX won't allow it).

4. Composition of Component

âž¡ Basically it means component inside another component.

6. {TitleComponent()} and {<TitleComponent/>} and {<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>} => everything is same.
