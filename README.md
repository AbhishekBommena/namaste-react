# Assignment - 3
-----------------------------

1. What is JSX ?
âž¡ JSX is not HTML in Javascript.
âž¡ JSX is a syntax. It is HTML like syntax OR XML like syntax.
âž¡ JSX is different , React is different.
For ex : const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"Core React");
    Basically this is core react way of creating react element.
    whereas , const heading = <h1>JSX way</h1>;
    This is JSX way of creating react element.


âž¡ JS engine don't understand JSX.
âž¡ JSX is transpiled before it reaches the JS Engine by parcel(Not itself but babel will do that). 
âž¡ So what happens is, JSX => React.createElement() => React element which is JS Object => Html element.
âž¡ All this conversion is done by Babel.

2. Super Power of JSX 
âž¡ Inside JSX Javascript can also be used with curly braces.
âž¡ JSX prevents cross-site scripting attacks(when data coming from a api and it is malicious jsx won't allow).

3. Composition of Component
âž¡ Basically it means component inside another component.

4. {TitleComponent()} and {<TitleComponent/>} and {<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>} => everything is same.
